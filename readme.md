## What is Dumbo

Dumbo is an application that reads Postgres logs and produces row update as in as JSON to Kafka or other streaming platforms. Dumbo has low operational overhead, requiring nothing but Postgres running and a log file to read from. This enables event sourcing architecture for any legacy application without the need to rewrite everything from scratch.
